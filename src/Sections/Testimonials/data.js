      'I am an Primary School English Teacher.  When covid happened we needed a way to teach and interact with students online.  Nick created the website Classpoint for us. It helps me to assess the students and students can enjoy the games they used to play when we had in person classes. Assessment and teaching with classpoint.ca has become a lot easier. Futhermore he developed other programs for us like connect four and scategories.  Now that students are back in the classroom we continue to play these games. Both the students and the other teachers at our school really enjoyed using his websites.',

      "I have been teaching English in Korea for 10 years.  When covid happened we were pushed to move everything online with very little notice.  Not all of my classroom games worked well online.  Classpoint helped me to use my regular classroom games online.  Nick's other site Scategories was super helpful as well because it is easy to use when I didn't have another lesson planned for that period.  They helped me out a lot this past year.",

      'I am an English teacher.  I use classpoint.ca to keep track of my students participation in the classroom and use it as a reward system.  The website allows me to track their participation during online classes, and makes it easy for me to see at a glance who has spoken in class so far.  When students get a certain number of points they get a class reward.  This was really helpful during covid because without it is is really hard to keep track of who is participating while teaching on zoom.',
